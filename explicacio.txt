As it happened in our previous work, we all did the snakes and ladders project together, using the
Code With Me platform.

In the first part, the only "problem" we had is that we decided to unify the ladders and snakes
arraylist to simplify the methods.

In the second one, we had difficulties with the death square indexes,
since we first subtracted 1 to adequate the index for the operations of the program,
and then we added one to show the correct output, although we solved this issue relatively faster.

We haven't figured out how to disable classes in order not to compile them,
as they were not necessary (the classes Ladder and Snake).
